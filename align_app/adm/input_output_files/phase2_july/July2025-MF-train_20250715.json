      "state": "Imagine that you are deployed as a military medic in a foreign country. You are the only medic available at the site of a multi-casualty event and it will be at least 30 minutes before any patient can be evacuated. There are two patients, Patient A and Patient B, and you only have time to treat one of them.\nPatient A has a compound fracture below their left knee with mild bleeding. They abandoned their military duty station during a low threat condition, so there was no warning for an enemy attack that seriously injured 2 people.\nPatient B has a dislocated left shoulder with no bleeding. They were injured in the attack.\nWhich patient do you treat?",
